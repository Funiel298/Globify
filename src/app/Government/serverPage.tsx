                        The Economist Intelligence Unit rated Norway a "full democracy" in 2022.

Reporters Without Borders ranked Norway 1st in the world in the 2019 Press Freedom Index. 
                        Freedom House's 2020 Freedom in the World report classified Norway as "free", scoring maximum points in the categories of "political rights" and "civil liberties".

                        Norway is a constitutional monarchy, where the king has a mainly symbolic power. 
                        The royal house is a branch of the princely family of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg, and the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in Germany. 
                        The functions of the king, Harald V, are mainly ceremonial, but he has influence as the symbol of national unity. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Although the constitution of 1814 grants important executive powers to the king, these are always exercised by the 
                        Council of State in the name of the king (King's Council, or cabinet). The king is also High Protector of the Church of 
                        Norway (the state church), Grand Master of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, and symbolically Supreme Commander of the Norwegian armed forces.
